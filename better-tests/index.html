      <p>I’ve always believed that studying (for a test) is cheating. Tests are supposed to test you on what you normally know to make sure you didn’t forget everything you just learned. However, studying artificially makes you seem like you know a bit more about a subject than you usually do, and it is temporary. It skews the results of the test, making you seem smarter than you really are.</p>
<p>Additionally, allowing people to study for a test makes the test also a test of how good you are at studying, not just a test of knowledge, understanding, and/or skills.</p>
<h1 id="the-purpose-of-tests"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#the-purpose-of-tests">#</a> the purpose of tests</h1>
<p>Tests were made simply to see how much you know. This is useful for both the teacher, who can assess how well their teaching methods are working, and the student, who can use the data to see what they need to work on.</p>
<p>Tests are also useful for seeing if someone is qualified for a position, but that isn’t necessary for the average test in schools.</p>
<p>However, <em>someone</em> came up with the <em>terrible</em> idea of making tests affect grades. Suddenly parents care about grades, and then they scare their children into getting good scores on those tests. In turn, the children found ways to easily avoid their parents’ punishments, such as cheating or studying.</p>
<h1 id="seans-very-flawed-solution"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#seans-very-flawed-solution">#</a> Sean’s very flawed solution</h1>
<p>Teachers shouldn’t write a fraction on a student’s test. They should just mark the questions the student got wrong. That way, a student will have to look through the test and see the problems they missed (if they care).</p>
<p>Perhaps there is some information that is absolutely necessary to know to understand the next unit/class. In that case, the test’s score should only be based on the questions that concern that information.</p>
<p>One might say this will make students care less about tests. I’d say that’s a good thing. Some information you learn isn’t very important anyways.</p>

      <p>brother use your intuition they give you a pickle stick cus they expect
      you to eat it separetly AFTER eating the sandwich, think about it
      logically</p>

      <p>if they could cut the pickle and expected you to eat it WITH the
      sandwich as in eating them at the same time then they'd DO that and put it
      IN the sandwich but no they don't instead they give you a pickle arrow
      separately its like carrot sticks with pizza you don't eat the carrot
      while eating the pizza you eat it after eating the pizza</p>

      <p>the goobers choosing to eat it before the sandwich simply didn't think
      about the question before answering and with more data sources you'd
      probably get more people saying they'd eat it after but then again I know
      some people would eat the carrot sticks before the pizza so atp its a
      preference thing</p>

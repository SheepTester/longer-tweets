      <p>Yesterday, I made massive progress in my dumb constructed language. It’s basically just a weird mix of English, Spanish, Esperanto, and French.</p>

<p>Objective case is the same as in English; it’s used when the noun is in a prepositional phrase or is the direct object.</p>
<h2 id="verbs"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#verbs">#</a> Verbs</h2>
<p>There are three tenses: the past, present, future, and past future.</p>
<p>The past tense of <em>mort</em> (kill) is <em>a mort</em>. <em>a</em> means “have,” so <em>a mort</em> is like English’s perfect tense: “have killed.” My conlang doesn’t make a distinction between simple past and perfect; I hope this doesn’t go wrong.</p>
<p>The future tense of <em>mort</em> is <em>t’mort</em>; <em>t’</em> means “to,” so <em>t’mort</em> is like “is to kill.” This isn’t how infinitives are formed in my language; this is just leftover feature from when I had infinitives. This can be combined with the past tense marker <em>a</em> to make <em>a t’mort</em>: “would kill.” I’m not sure what tense this would be called; I think “subjunctive,” but a more sensible name would probably be “past future.” I am not an expert.</p>
<p>Verbs can be made into nouns by adding the <em>-ac</em> suffix, like English’s <em>-tion</em> suffix (act of <em>X</em>). So <em>mortac</em> is the act of killing.</p>
<p>I’m stealing Spanish’s flipped “Y pleases X” for “X likes Y” sentences. <em>plez</em> is “please” in my language, so</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He likes to kill fish.</p>
<p><em>Mortac d’pic plez lo.</em></p>
<p>lit. Act of killing fish pleases him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I’m thinking of making a new preposition here because <em>mortac d’pic</em>, or the murder of the fish, could mean the fish are either the murderers or the victims. <em>mortac PREP pic</em> would clarify that the fish are the direct objects of the action, and <em>d’</em> would be used for the subject; it’s used for possession as well, so I think this makes sense.)</p>
<p>I haven’t figured out participles yet. Will do.</p>
<h2 id="other-things"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#other-things">#</a> Other things</h2>
<p>The vocabulary I have for this language is pretty dumb. Allow me to enlighten you.</p>
<p>With the slightly arbitrary word making process I have, “time” (ES <em>tiempo</em>, EO <em>tempo</em>), “<strong>temp</strong>erature,” and “<strong>temp</strong>orary” are all the same word (<em>temp</em>). I haven’t made enough sentences to see if this causes a problem.<span data-dumb=** data-fixing-markdown-syntax-highlighting-lol></span></p>
<p>A bigger problem is egg (ES <em>huevo</em>, EO <em>ovo</em>) and sheep (ES <em>oveja</em>, English “ovine”) are the same word: <em>ov</em>. However, I see this as a feature; they’re both very innocent words, so children’s books would probably play on this a lot.</p>
<p>The plurals of nouns are generally just given <em>-s</em>, unless the singular form ends in an <em>s</em>, in which case the suffix becomes <em>-'s</em>. Also, if the singular ends in a <em>q</em>, the <em>q</em> becomes an <em>x</em> instead of an <em>s</em> being added.</p>
<pre><code>bov -&gt; bovs (cows)
urs -&gt; urs's (bears)
cliq -&gt; clix (clicks)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="sentences"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#sentences">#</a> Sentences</h2>
<p>Since adjectives come before nouns in my language, if they come after, they’re probably the predicate. From my last post, I explained how nouns, adjectives, and prepositional phrases can be implicitly casted to a predicate where their translation in English would have an added “to be.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>L’person intel.</em></p>
<p>Lit. The person intelligent</p>
<p>The person is intelligent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>L’bov un magiqist.</em></p>
<p>Lit. The cow a magician</p>
<p>The cow is a magician.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>J’d’California.</em></p>
<p>Lit. I of California</p>
<p>I am from California.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now, prepositional phrases are a bit confusing. For example, <em>l’ov d’l’bov</em> could either mean “the egg of the cow” or “The egg is the cow’s.” Maybe that’s okay. Not sure.</p>
<p><em>Everything here is subject to change.</em></p>

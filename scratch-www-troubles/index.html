      <p>One day, I decided to see if I could see the progress on the project page redesign.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be too hard, I thought. I just had to clone their repository and follow their very helpful and detailed steps to build it somehow. And it would have worked. But there were a few problems.</p>
<h1 id="cloning-the-repository"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#cloning-the-repository">#</a> cloning the repository</h1>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/LLK/scratch-www.git
</code></pre>
<p>I did, after making a <code>test</code> folder in my Documents (because I didn’t intend on keeping it; I imagined it would be pretty big in terms of file size).</p>
<p>It didn’t take too long for it to reach 22%, and then it stopped. It was probably the bad internet, I thought, since we were on vacation.</p>
<p>And then it failed.</p>
<p><img src="../images/git-clone-fail.png" alt="it failed to clone the repository" title="At first if you don't succeed, try try again."></p>
<p>So I tried again multiple times, and it still didn’t work. As it was loading, I decided to try out Vim, and every time I checked back on it, it had failed. Oh well.</p>
<p>After a lot of time, I decided to switch to my mom’s apparently unlimited data plan thing, which was a lot faster. The cloning took quite a long time at 39% (probably a large file?), but it finished with no problems. Yay!</p>
<h1 id="following-their-very-helpful-steps"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#following-their-very-helpful-steps">#</a> following their very helpful steps</h1>
<h2 id="getting-the-packages"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#getting-the-packages">#</a> getting the packages</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/LLK/scratch-www"><code>scratch-www</code></a> README said to run</p>
<pre><code>npm install
</code></pre>
<p>which I did. It took a while, and Node outputted a bunch of security vulnerabilities that didn’t concern me much at this point in time.</p>
<p><img src="../images/lol-securproblems.png" alt="&quot;npm WARN notice (SECURITY) xyz has the following vulnerability: 1 low. Go here for more details: https://nodesecurity.io/advisories?search=xyz&amp;version=1.2.3 etc&quot; (many times)" title="Hopefully this doesn't break anything."></p>
<p>Now I see why people joke about the sheer amount of dependencies in a single Node project.</p>
<p><img src="../images/too-many-node-dependencies.png" alt="a lot of node dependencies" title="On the contrary, libraries in Scratch is currently a foreign concept. This may change in Scratch 3.0."></p>
<h2 id="building-the-things"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#building-the-things">#</a> building the things</h2>
<p>Then they told me to run</p>
<pre><code>npm run build
</code></pre>
<p>and so I did. Amongst the errors, there was:</p>
<pre><code>'make' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
</code></pre>
<p>I tried running the next step (the README said building wasn’t necessary), but the same error arose.</p>
<p>It turned out I didn’t have some <code>make.exe</code> thing, which Unix system things have but Windows 10 doesn’t. There are ways to get it, but it’s rather complicated and would require too many (more than 1) administrator password, I imagined.</p>
<p>At this point I decided that doing this was hopeless. It’s impossible to do this on a Windows, I thought.</p>
<p>Suddenly, after some more Googling, I found a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/make"><code>make</code> Node package</a>. It looked promising, so I installed it.</p>
<p>It seemed to add the <code>make</code> command to the bash thingy.</p>
<pre><code>npm run build
</code></pre>
<p>worked! It didn’t seem to do anything, so I continued with the steps.</p>
<h2 id="running-the-things"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#running-the-things">#</a> running the things</h2>
<p>I ran</p>
<pre><code>make translations
npm start
</code></pre>
<p>and an error came up. As I expected, the Node <code>make</code> package wasn’t perfect.</p>
<p>However, I found a <code>Makefile</code> file which seemed to define the “functions” that the commands called.</p>
<pre><code class="language-makefile"><span class="hljs-section">translations:</span>
	./bin/get-localized-urls localized-urls.json
	./bin/build-locales node_modules/scratchr2_translations/www/translations intl
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-makefile"><span class="hljs-section">start:</span>
	<span class="hljs-variable">$(NODE)</span> ./dev-server/index.js
</code></pre>
<p>I tried running each line separately, and surprisingly, that worked.</p>
<pre><code>./bin/get-localized-urls localized-urls.json
./bin/build-locales node_modules/scratchr2_translations/www/translations intl
node ./dev-server/index.js
</code></pre>
<p>Scratch build successfully. Non-redesigned pages gave an error, but I ignored them thinking they wouldn’t be a big deal.</p>
<h1 id="fixing-the-project-page"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#fixing-the-project-page">#</a> fixing the project page</h1>
<p>There was just one problem: when I tried to open a preview project page (at <code>/preview/115618276/</code>), it was empty. I would expect that if they were working on the project pages (as evidenced by the issues), it would work here too (there was only one branch).</p>
<p>The console gave a 404 error trying to GET <code>/session/</code>, which I assumed was a non-redesigned page. Thus, I needed to somehow make non-redesigned pages work.</p>
<p>The README had something to say about a “fallback,” which I assumed was relevant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blah <code>FALLBACK=https://scratch.mit.edu</code> blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I reran the last command but with the <code>FALLBACK</code> thing appended to it. Surprisingly there were no errors:</p>
<pre><code>node ./dev-server/index.js FALLBACK=https://scratch.mit.edu
</code></pre>
<p>However, it still didn’t work.</p>
<p>Looking back at the <code>Makefile</code> file from earlier, it seemed these “environment variables” are put before the command name, a foreign concept to me.</p>
<pre><code class="language-makefile">NODE= NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=8000 node
</code></pre>
<p>Nonetheless, I tried putting the <code>FALLBACK</code> thing before <code>node</code>, and surprisingly, there still were no errors.</p>
<pre><code>FALLBACK=https://scratch.mit.edu node ./dev-server/index.js
</code></pre>
<p>And it worked! Yay.</p>
<h1 id="the-result"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#the-result">#</a> the result</h1>
<p>Here’s the long-awaited project page redesign:
<img src="../images/preview-project.png" alt="use your imagination" title="The background feels brighter. But not as bright as the Discord light theme/Google Drive redesign! For some reason, people like the Google Drive redesign despite it having the same background colour as the Discord light theme.">
<em>(not included: the studios sidebar section)</em></p>
<p>Changes I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>the view count is capped at 100 (similar to studio projects). I knew this already from the issues</li>
<li>profile picture of the creator</li>
<li>no more last changed date (or did they remove the shared date?)</li>
<li>a copy link button, which I’d assume would be very helpful</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, it may look like they’re removed the remix tree, report button, share button, comment section, etc, but because they’re still working on it, I wouldn’t assume their removal this early.</p>
<h1 id="what-i-learned-from-this-experience"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#what-i-learned-from-this-experience">#</a> what I learned from this experience</h1>
<p>Nothing lol</p>
<p>jk I learned that there really is a lot of Node dependencies in a Node project. Yikes!</p>

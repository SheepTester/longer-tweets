Tables in any markup language are a pain. Markdown's tables are certainly better than HTML's.

I'm not an expert in the IPA; this is my best guess.

| Letter | IPA              | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| a      | /a/              |
| b      | /b/              |
| c      | /s/ or /k/       | Like Spanish, it becomes soft before _e_ and _i_ with an /s/ sound and hard before _a_, _o_, and _u_ with a /k/ sound. The difference here is that _c_ becomes soft at the end of a word in my language, but not in Spanish nor English nor any other sane language. To preserve a /k/ or /s/ sound before a different vowel, _c_ is usually changed to _q_ and _s_ respectively. |
| d      | /d̪/              |
| e      | /e/              |
| f      | /f/              |
| g      | /ʒ/ or /g/       | Like the letter _c_, _g_ also becomes soft and hard. However, it does not become soft at the end of a word. To preserve a /ʒ/ sound, _g_ is usually changed to a _j_. To preserve a /g/ sound, an apostrophe is added after the _g_.                                                                                                                                              |
| h      | /∅/              | Like Spanish and other Romance languages, _h_ is always silent. It doesn't combine with other letters to form diagraphs. It's only used in loanwords.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| i      | /i/              |
| j      | /ʒ/              |
| k      | /k/              | _K_ usually isn't used in my language because I don't like how it's two strokes in my handwriting. _Q_ looks a lot cooler. Thus, _k_ is only used in loanwords.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| l      | /l/ or /o/       | When _l_ starts a word or is before a vowel, it is pronounced /l/. When _l_ ends a word after a consonant, it is pronounced /o/. When _l_ is after a vowel and is before a consonant or at the end of a word, it merges with the vowel and is jointly pronounced /o/.                                                                                                             |
| m      | /m/              | /əm/ after a consonant at the end of a word.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| n      | /n/              | /ən/ after a consonant at the end of a word.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| o      | /o/              |
| p      | /p/              |
| q      | /k/              | _Q_ doesn't merge with _u_. When it's its own word, it's pronounced /ky/ (means "than").                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| r      | /ɾ/, /x/, or /ɻ/ | When _r_ starts a word, it is pronounced /ɻ/. Otherwise, before a vowel it is pronounced /ɾ/. After a vowel, it is pronounced /x/ if it's not followed by a vowel. /ɚ/ after a consonant at the end of a word.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| s      | /s/              |
| t      | /t̪/              |
| u      | /u/              |
| v      | /b/ or /v/       | Pronounced /b/ when it starts a word; /v/ otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| w      | /w/              | Only used in loanwords.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| x      | /ks/             |
| y      | /i̯/ or /j/       | I list two pronunciations because I'm not very good with the IPA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| z      | /z/              |
| '      | /∅/ or /ə/       | Ideally silent if possible, but a schwa can be inserted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

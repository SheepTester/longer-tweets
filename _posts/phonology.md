Tables in any markup language are a pain. Markdown's tables are certainly better than HTML's.

I'm not an expert in the IPA; this is my best guess.

Letter | IPA | Notes
---|---|---
a | /a/ |
b | /b/ |
c | /s/ or /k/ | Like Spanish, it becomes soft before *e* and *i* with an /s/ sound and hard before *a*, *o*, and *u* with a /k/ sound. The difference here is that *c* becomes soft at the end of a word in my language, but not in Spanish nor English nor any other sane language. To preserve a /k/ or /s/ sound before a different vowel, *c* is usually changed to *q* and *s* respectively.
d | /d̪/ |
e | /e/ |
f | /f/ |
g | /ʒ/ or /g/ | Like the letter *c*, *g* also becomes soft and hard. However, it does not become soft at the end of a word. To preserve a /ʒ/ sound, *g* is usually changed to a *j*. To preserve a /g/ sound, an apostrophe is added after the *g*.
h | /∅/ | Like Spanish and other Romance languages, *h* is always silent. It doesn't combine with other letters to form diagraphs. It's only used in loanwords.
i | /i/ |
j | /ʒ/ |
k | /k/ | *K* usually isn't used in my language because I don't like how it's two strokes in my handwriting. *Q* looks a lot cooler. Thus, *k* is only used in loanwords.
l | /l/ or /o/ | When *l* starts a word or is before a vowel, it is pronounced /l/. When *l* ends a word after a consonant, it is pronounced /o/. When *l* is after a vowel and is before a consonant or at the end of a word, it merges with the vowel and is jointly pronounced /o/.
m | /m/ | /əm/ after a consonant at the end of a word.
n | /n/ | /ən/ after a consonant at the end of a word.
o | /o/ |
p | /p/ |
q | /k/ | *Q* doesn't merge with *u*. When it's its own word, it's pronounced /ky/ (means "than").
r | /ɾ/, /x/, or /ɻ/ | When *r* starts a word, it is pronounced /ɻ/. Otherwise, before a vowel it is pronounced /ɾ/. After a vowel, it is pronounced /x/ if it's not followed by a vowel. /ɚ/ after a consonant at the end of a word.
s | /s/ |
t | /t̪/ |
u | /u/ |
v | /b/ or /v/ | Pronounced /b/ when it starts a word; /v/ otherwise.
w | /w/ | Only used in loanwords.
x | /ks/ |
y | /i̯/ or /j/ | I list two pronunciations because I'm not very good with the IPA.
z | /z/ |
' | /∅/ or /ə/ | Ideally silent if possible, but a schwa can be inserted.

*Everything here is subject to change.*

Yesterday, I made massive progress in my dumb constructed language. It's basically just a weird mix of English, Spanish, Esperanto, and French.

## Pronouns

Pronoun | Nominative | Objective | Possessive
---|---|---|---
1st person singular | *je* (*j'*) | *me* | *mi* (*m'*)
1st person plural | *nos* | *nos* | *nos*
2nd person singular | *tu* (*t'*) | *tu* | *ti* (*t'*)
2nd person plural | *vos* | *vos* | *vos*
3rd person singular | *lo* | *lo* | *d'lo*
3rd person plural | *los* | *los* | *d'los*

Objective case is the same as in English; it's used when the noun is in a prepositional phrase or is the direct object.

## Verbs

There are three tenses: the past, present, future, and past future.

The past tense of *mort* (kill) is *a mort*. *a* means "have," so *a mort* is like English's perfect tense: "have killed." My conlang doesn't make a distinction between simple past and perfect; I hope this doesn't go wrong.

The future tense of *mort* is *t'mort*; *t'* means "to," so *t'mort* is like "is to kill." This isn't how infinitives are formed in my language; this is just leftover feature from when I had infinitives. This can be combined with the past tense marker *a* to make *a t'mort*: "would kill." I'm not sure what tense this would be called; I think "subjunctive," but a more sensible name would probably be "past future." I am not an expert.

Verbs can be made into nouns by adding the *-ac* suffix, like English's *-tion* suffix (act of *X*). So *mortac* is the act of killing.

I'm stealing Spanish's flipped "Y pleases X" for "X likes Y" sentences. *plez* is "please" in my language, so

> He likes to kill fish.
>
> *Mortac d'pic plez lo.*
>
> lit. Act of killing fish pleases him.

(I'm thinking of making a new preposition here because *mortac d'pic*, or the murder of the fish, could mean the fish are either the murderers or the victims. *mortac PREP pic* would clarify that the fish are the direct objects of the action, and *d'* would be used for the subject; it's used for possession as well, so I think this makes sense.)

I haven't figured out participles yet. Will do.

## Other things

The vocabulary I have for this language is pretty dumb. Allow me to enlighten you.

With the slightly arbitrary word making process I have, "time" (ES *tiempo*, EO *tempo*), "**temp**erature," and "**temp**orary" are all the same word (*temp*). I haven't made enough sentences to see if this causes a problem.<span data-dumb=** data-fixing-markdown-syntax-highlighting-lol></span>

A bigger problem is egg (ES *huevo*, EO *ovo*) and sheep (ES *oveja*, English "ovine") are the same word: *ov*. However, I see this as a feature; they're both very innocent words, so children's books would probably play on this a lot.

The plurals of nouns are generally just given *-s*, unless the singular form ends in an *s*, in which case the suffix becomes *-'s*. Also, if the singular ends in a *q*, the *q* becomes an *x* instead of an *s* being added.

```
bov -> bovs (cows)
urs -> urs's (bears)
cliq -> clix (clicks)
```

## Sentences

Since adjectives come before nouns in my language, if they come after, they're probably the predicate. From my last post, I explained how nouns, adjectives, and prepositional phrases can be implicitly casted to a predicate where their translation in English would have an added "to be."

> *L'person intel.*
>
> Lit. The person intelligent
>
> The person is intelligent.

> *L'bov un magiqist.*
>
> Lit. The cow a magician
>
> The cow is a magician.

> *J'd'California.*
>
> Lit. I of California
>
> I am from California.

Right now, prepositional phrases are a bit confusing. For example, *l'ov d'l'bov* could either mean "the egg of the cow" or "The egg is the cow's." Maybe that's okay. Not sure.

*Everything here is subject to change.*

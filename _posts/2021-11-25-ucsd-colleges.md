This post serves as a text-based supplement to a video I recently made showing
off each college's dorms.

Also, it's **very important** that you're aware of some recent changes to the
colleges in the past few years:

- A new Seventh college was founded in 2019, with its first students in fall 2020.

- Sixth College has since moved in 2020 from Camp Snoopy and Sixth Apartments in the
  southeastern corner of campus to north of Muir, which is in the middle of
  campus. The difference in quality of the dorms are very significant.

Many online resources are out of date, so be aware of these changes. I'll cover
the recent changes in my post below.

## Colleges?

Unlike most universities, UC San Diego splits its undergraduate students into
different colleges, which are like Hogwarts houses except you get to rank the
colleges you want to get into, rather than some old hat.

Your college is just more than instilling pride for your college or to have a
closer support group of advisors or students. Each college has its own GEs
(graduation requirements), and the dorms that first- and second-years stay in
vary greatly depending on the college.

The video above shows the diversity of the dorms between colleges; here, I'll
just give a quick summary on each college's GEs.

## Revelle

Revelle has a lot of GEs because it requires that you take five quarters of
natural science courses, regardless of whether your major is a science major or
not. Maybe that would be good if you intend on majoring in something bio, chem,
or physics related, but otherwise the GEs are a lot.

## Muir

Muir is nice. Their GEs have been known to be very flexible and light, so it's a
very popular choice.

## Marshall

Marshall's GEs aren't very notable, I think. They're somewhat easy.

## Warren

Warren's GEs are very good for engineering majors because they're easier for
them.

## ERC

ERC is an international themed college, so its GEs require you to:

- Know a foreign language at a certain level
- Take three courses about some region of the world
- Take five courses of Making of the Modern World, which is ERC's writing
  program.

ERC has a lot of GEs, which is not very ideal.

## Sixth and Seventh

Sixth and Seventh's GEs are both pretty nice as well.

## Conclusion

Here's a table qualitatively summarizing each college's GEs:

| College  | GEs                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------- |
| Revelle  | pain                            |
| Muir     | nice                            |
| Marshall | meh                             |
| Warren   | nice if engineer; meh otherwise |
| ERC      | pain                            |
| Sixth    | nice                            |
| Seventh  | nice                            |

If you don't plan on living off campus for your first and second years, then you
should also preview the dorms in my [video comparing each college's residential
halls at UC San Diego](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzwg_tuCXNI).

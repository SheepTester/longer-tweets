Having used vanilla JavaScript for a good portion of my time playing around with web development, I 

why not frameworks: 

- strict project layout
- build system

react benefit is reactivity/declarativeness

since i was able to implement it myself for UGWA, i think react is fairly transparent; you have a rough idea of what's going on under the hood

haven't looked out for frameworks much because of the above, but these are what i should look out for:

react annoyances:

- no function initializer for use ref like use state
- sometimes use effect needs latest value of state without running use effect again (solution is use ref but then you have state and ref if you want it to affect rendering too)
- hard to keep track of what is or should be memoized for hook dependencies
- (elm issue too) modifying state in a deeply nested object is verbose
- date Intl API results in hydration errors
- date.now and local storage are technically impure but it sucks that they need to be initialized in a use effect
- no built in class list

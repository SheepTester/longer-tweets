people use squash commits and rebases because they want their commit history to be clean. is this just for vanity?

merge commits are better: 

- more granular blames
  - see both the commit level context (eg formatting or a bug fix) and PR
  - GitHub links to PR that commit is part of
  - while PRs *should* be small, they are not always so in practice
    - especially in the earliest PRs of the repo when the project starts out, since that's where
  - from experience at ACM and internship
- why squash commits on feature branches into main?
- easier to split PR into multiple steps and merge upstream PRs into later PRs without conflicts

only benefit of squash commits is to keep .git folder small (eg if you accidentally commit node modules in a PR then delete it)

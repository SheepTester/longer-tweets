This is my take on [Gamepro5's article "Genders,"](https://gamepro5.com/news#Genders) in which he critiques in a highly logical way the usage of gender pronouns in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Beware! The linked article uses terms related to biological reproduction processes, which some cultures may find taboo.

Firstly, I was raised in a generally politically liberal area, so my views generally lean that way as well. However, in seventh grade, I believed that as humans, our only purpose in life, like all other life forms, was to reproduce; thus, because LGBTQ+ people don't intend on doing so, they have "failed" life.

Though I still agree with part of my old reasoning, I have since moved on from this belief. I would instead argue that although our biological purpose is indeed to pass on our genes, as humans, we perceive ourselves to be able to do more. There is no true "meaning of life" since everything in the universe will die eventually, so we might as well enjoy it the best we can. (Also, making children nowadays is a probably bad idea given the direction our climate is going and that they'll be the ones who have to deal with it.) When someone chooses to deviate from traditional social norms and requests that you recognize them in a specific way, you should respect their request not only to help make their lives even more enjoyable but also because such deviations still require a significant amount of courage--some people. Likewise, it is especially important not to prescribe your own beliefs onto others; let people live the way they want to live (unless you believe it is obstructing your own and others' ability to enjoy life, such as when they are committing genocide, but that is probably common sense).

The views I express in this article are not meant to represent those of any group or person other than me. Also, I didn't do much research while writing this, and I am not an expert in this area, so assume all my claims are unfounded; they're just based on observations I have made about this.

> In English, for example, there are two pronouns.

Actually, there are four pronouns, but indeed in strict English, only two of the three singular ones are used for people. Note that "they" is often used in the singular for an unknown or nonbinary gender.

> However, some insecure individual thought to itself and said that the obvious catalyst for oppressing the gays and the transgenders are their pronouns, and so began their crusade to demonize anybody who use the wrong gender pronoun.

No, this is a collaboration of many people, not one person. Also, pronouns aren't why they are being oppressed, but they are one of the most obvious hints to one's gender.

> This kind of ties into the fact that I don't like how people who try to fight for genders not mattering complain that their gender pronoun matters.

They fight for genders not mattering when deciding how to treat a person, such as determining one's wage. However, gender is also part of some people's identity, and classifying someone as something they aren't is pretty rude.

> As a logical human being, I suggest the following:

> Genders should be purely functional. [...] Your pronoun does not matter and it does not dictate how you should behave in the world, it just indicates your reproductive function in the universe.

You're describing one's *sex*, not gender. A quick recap:

- One's **sex** is their biological role in sexual reproduction. You are born with this and it's not very easy to change this after birth.

- One's **gender** is the degree to which they believe they conform with a gender stereotype, such as how they dress or behave. This includes their preferred pronoun. This is more personality-based, so it can change throughout one's life, though not very often probably because of societal norms.

I'm not sure which one sexual orientation is based on, but contrary to its name I'm pretty sure it's based on gender. Maybe in June, I'll ask some Scratchers about it.

> Your pronoun simply defines your rudimentary purpose in nature, but you can still do everything else that the other gender can do as long as it isn't biologically impossible.

I don't see why one's sex should be constantly (albeit indirectly) referred to in everyday speech. It's kind of like having to dress in a uniform based on the family you are from **TODO**. Allowing one to choose their gender pronoun, however, can help them better express what they perceive to be their identity.

> I understand that me saying let people live the way they want to could be interpreted as you can change your gender if you want, which is true, I am not proposing to make it illegal to rip off your [male reproductive organ] or glue one on.

Indeed, one does not have to unnaturally change their biological sex or their body in general to change their gender.

> I will never be bothered to try to figure out what to call you.

Do you do the same for someone's name? Historically, names changed more often than pronouns because traditionally a wife adopts their husband's last name upon marriage. Nowadays, some people feel safe enough to change their pronouns, which I feel like is social progress in the right direction.

> If you aren't a "he" or a "she", you are an "it".

Singular "they" is already standard and implemented in most dialects of English; use that instead if you want people to understand you.

> Wanting to be called "they" is possibly the dumbest pronoun of all because it implies there are multiple subjects.

In English, "you" is used for both singular and plural and can be distinguished depending on the context. Generally, I don't find it difficult when someone uses singular "they"; if the antecedent is unclear, they can always repeat the noun like when two inanimate objects are being discussed. Context also helps since some actions make it clear whether the subject is meant to be human.

> The choice to change genders must logically be the consequence of the social constructs of genders themselves. To explain why, I will propose an analogy. Say you don't have legs, but you were born without legs and as such do not know what your life would be if you had legs. Your only initiative to get legs would be the social aspect, being you seeing people around you walk around with legs. If you were born in a dark isolated room you would never want legs because you never needed them as far as you were concerned from your frame of reference.

Indeed, the concept of genders is a social construct. However, your analogy assumes that people change genders only to experience the other gender's body; that's not usually the case. A person may not conform to their gender's stereotype, so they may want to change their gender to avoid societal expectations.

> If it has nothing to do with your biology and it just has to do with your feelings, it is because of society because you logically cannot be born feeling like you were not supposed to be in this gender as it is assigned at birth and you don't know what the other gender is like.

Precisely, but when one's personality conforms with the gender stereotype that is traditionally associated with the other sex, then they may be inclined to change.

> If there were zero social stereotypes surrounding genders, I promise the concept of a transgender would not exist and nobody would go through this, and as such, they would be more comfortable with their bodies and would not get pissed when people use the wrong gender pronoun.

As I said, it's not necessarily that they are uncomfortable with their bodies. A gender pronoun is perceived to instead be associated with the gender's stereotypes.

If you use the wrong gender pronoun, you implicitly remind them that they should be following a stereotype that they don't relate with.

To reiterate: "he" is not used for those who are biologically male; it is used to refer to those who are meant to follow the male gender stereotype.

> if I call you an "it" does not mean you are reduced to an inanimate object, because if the French language and so many other languages throw around genders to random objects, why can't we humans also be "it"s in English?

Using "it" does imply that the antecedent is inanimate. It's not common to refer to a person by the pronoun "it" unless you intend on dehumanizing them, so if you intend on communicating effectively in English, just use singular "they."

> In conclusion, you should not need to change your gender to fit into society.

It's not just to fit into society; it's so that you feel your identity can be safely and accurately expressed without having to hide parts of it due to old societal norms.

Today, we will analyze the following text:

We will first define a few root terms.

> *f’* — that (subordinating conjunction); *fan* — when (subordinating conjunction); *j’* — I (first person singular nominative case pronoun); *a* — have, (past tense marker); *jov* — young; *co* — with; *un* — one; *jerk* — jerk (borrowed); *clam* — call; *as* — as; *los* — they; *me* — me (first person singular objective case pronoun); *much* — a lot; *e* — and; *ashol* — asshole; *simpl* — simple; *cret* — create; *le* — this; *la* — that; *servr* — server; *raj* — rage; *-e* — (adverbial ending); *ban* — ban; *-’d* — (passive voice suffix); *su* (*s’*) — one’s, his, her, its, their (third person possessive case pronoun); *general* — general; *plus* — more; *suxesful* — successful; *q* /ky/ — than; *on* — one; *reg* — rule; *nicnom* — nickname; *pork’* — because; *camb* — change; *nom* — name; *racist* — racist; *ofensif* — offensive; *sed* — but; *alt* — other; *amiq* (plural *amix*) — friend; *temp* — time, temperature, temporary; *asi* — so, therefore; *en* — in, on, at; *fit* — fit; *suor* — swear (verb); *sam* — same; *fair* — fair; *tret* — treat (verb); *-ac* — -tion, -ment (act of); *tod* — everyone; *lo* — it, he, she; *term* — end; *suxid* — succeed; *cad* — every; *pos* — possible; *voy* — way; *buli* — bully; *k’* — what (pronoun)

Let us begin with the first sentence, its literal translation, and the original sentence:

> *Fane j’a jov, j’a co uns jerks f’j’a clam k’as amix.*
>
> When I have young, I have with some jerks that I have call what as friends.
>
> When I was young I hung out with some jerks that I called friends.

The subject and predicate can be found by removing the dependent clauses:

> J’a co uns jerks.
>
> I have with some jerks.
>
> I hung out with some jerks.

The subject here is *j’*, and the predicate is *a co uns jerks*. The predicate is formed using “have,” which is used as a past tense marker here, and a prepositional phrase “with some jerks.” There is no actual verb, so the prepositional phrase is assumed to be the predicate as “to be with some jerks.” Thus, it is interpreted as “I have been with some jerks” or “I was with some jerks.”

The first dependent clause is marked with the subordinate conjunction fane, which is formed from *fan* (“when”) and *-e*. The adverbial marker *-e* on subordinate conjunctions and prepositions indicates that the dependent clause or prepositional phrase describes the action rather than a noun. In this case, it is specifying when the action (hanging out with jerks) happened. The subject here is also *j’*, but the predicate now has an *a* + adjective construction. Like the prepositional phrase, the adjective is assumed to be the predicate as “to be young.” Together, the clause can be interpreted as “When I was young.”

The second dependent clause is marked with the subordinate conjunction *f’*. *F’* clauses that describe nouns must contain a *k’* (“what”) that refers to the noun being described (in this case, the jerks). The clause says that Gamepro5 called someone or some people friends, and since we know the noun being described, we can plug it in: Gamepro5 called the jerks friends.

The plural forms of nouns ending in a *q* merge the *q* and *s* into an *x*.

Let us analyze the second sentence:

> *Los a buli me much, e los a ashols simple.*
>
> They have bully me a lot, and they assholes simply.
>
> They bullied me a lot and were just assholes.

The first independent clause in this compound sentence is straightforward. The second independent clause introduces an *a* + noun construction. Like for the other constructions, the noun is assumed to be the predicate and becomes “to be assholes,” so the clause can be interpreted as “They were simply assholes.”

The third sentence contains this dependent clause:

> *fane j’a ban’d d’su servr*
>
> when I have was banned (by) from their server
>
> when I got banned from their server

The *-’d* suffix can be used to “flip” transitive verbs around, or make them passive voice. Ban means “to ban (someone)”; adding *-’d* would make it “to be banned by (someone).” Also note that direct objects can be left out as it is here.
